Farmers ultimately paid for the Van Ness family’s hotel accommodation for seven months and approved a budget of $25,900 to have the home professionally cleaned — a fraction of what it would have cost to follow the advice of experts who insisted that the only way to remove the contaminants was to strip away every surface the smoke touched. The company did not address detailed questions from The Times about the contamination found inside the Van Ness home after the insurer-led remediation, or about the carcinogens detected in the family’s hair, saying that “we cannot comment on individual claims or customers.”.",

It indicates that the home is contaminated with potentially harmful chemicals derived from tobacco smoke,” explained Neal Benowitz, MD, a UC San Francisco professor emeritus of medicine and co-author of a recent paper on thirdhand smoke. The threat of thirdhand smoke exposure is similar to that of secondhand smoke exposure, an increased risk of cancer chief among them. “In mice, researchers have found that thirdhand smoke exposure causes DNA damage, can cause or promote cancer, cause immune dysfunction and behavior disturbances,” Benowitz told Medical Xpress. “Studies of people exposed to thirdhand smoke found changes in blood proteins that have been associated with inflammation and heart disease.”. He warned that the most at-risk populations include people with allergies and asthma, as well as children, “who crawl on the floor, can put objects contaminated with thirdhand smoke into their mouths, and can absorb it through the skin.”. While the threats are similar, thirdhand smoke behaves a bit differently from secondhand smoke — and may be more toxic.",

I recommend using an explore-then-commit approach rather than piloting AI in your organization. **Phase 1: Open Learning / Exploration:** Your team can use AI products/technology during this 30-day period without having a defined objective. When an owner asks why AI pilots continue to fail, this is usually one reason among others: the team is forcing AI into a small scope of application that is not the best first success for that business. A straightforward small business AI implementation approach may be simply to spend 30 days documenting your explorations, identifying patterns, and then deciding on one project to focus on while measuring its impact.",

The real value emerges when AI analyzes those notes for compliance, flags missing elements for reimbursement, and ensures documentation actually serves both clinical and financial needs. 2026 will see the first standardized billing codes for AI-augmented services, but the real challenge is proving these tools actually improve outcomes enough to justify reimbursement. The next 12 months won’t see AI replace therapists, or digital therapeutics take over the behavioral healthcare industry. It will be the year practices realize that AI’s real value isn’t in patient-facing tools, but in making the business and clinical operations smarter. The practices that thrive will be those that look beyond the surface-level AI hype and invest in tools that actually drive throughput, ensure compliance, and—most importantly—turn the flood of data into better patient outcomes and sustainable revenue.",

In 2026, software developers should expect AI tools and agents will transform the development pipeline, from detecting bugs in code to triaging code defects and improving security, Wysopal says. Developer will have to learn how to securely interact with AI systems embedded in their integrated development environments, continuous-integration pipelines, and code-review workflows, Wysopal says. \"Developers need to treat AI-generated code as potentially vulnerable and follow a security testing and review process as they would for any human-generated code,\" Wysopal says. Development teams that focus on security are more likely to benefit from the productivity of AI without the need to rework bad-quality and insecure code, Nair says.",

In April, security experts warned that developers using LLMs for code generation may face a new supply chain attack dubbed “slopsquatting.” Coined by Python Software Foundation (PSF) developer in residence, Seth Larson, the term refers to attackers exploiting LLMs’ tendency to hallucinate non-existent software packages. The guidance offered practical security recommendations for developers building AI agents powered by LLMs. It looks to address emerging risks as AI systems become more autonomous, tool-using and multi-agent, operating without human prompts and adapting dynamically.",

AI tools also come with entirely new types of security vulnerabilities, the most common of which is known as prompt injection and stems from the fact that it is very hard to control what LLMs interpret as instructions to execute or as passive data to analyze. This is known as indirect prompt injection and is a major problem in the age of AI agents where LLMs are linked with third-party tools to be able to access data for context or to perform tasks. These attacks can at the very least lead to sensitive data exfiltration, but can also trick the AI agent to perform other rogue tasks using the tools at its disposal, including potentially malicious code execution.",

The threat of thirdhand smoke exposure is similar to that of secondhand smoke exposure, an increased risk of cancer chief among them. “In mice, researchers have found that thirdhand smoke exposure causes DNA damage, can cause or promote cancer, cause immune dysfunction and behavior disturbances,” Benowitz told Medical Xpress. “Studies of people exposed to thirdhand smoke found changes in blood proteins that have been associated with inflammation and heart disease.”. He warned that the most at-risk populations include people with allergies and asthma, as well as children, “who crawl on the floor, can put objects contaminated with thirdhand smoke into their mouths, and can absorb it through the skin.”. While the threats are similar, thirdhand smoke behaves a bit differently from secondhand smoke — and may be more toxic.",

[Nicholas Murray]’s Composite Test Pattern Generator is a beautifully-made, palm-sized tool that uses an ESP32-based development board to output different test patterns in PAL/NTSC. That feature made it trivial to output NTSC or PAL video to a compatible display. But [Nicholas]’s device has a number of significant advantages: it’s small, it’s fast, it has its own battery and integrated charger, and the little color screen mirroring the chosen test pattern is a great confirmation feature. This is a slick little device, and it’s not [Nicholas]’s first test pattern generator. ## 10 thoughts on “Pocket-sized Test Pattern Generator Helps Check Those CRTs”. Both PAL & SECAM were 60;s developments, but the US TV stations had already invested in color broadcast equipment.

This model will assume that the available test data are from the Fe-zeolite catalyst, or similar variants, thus allowing, for the reaction routes described in the literature for such catalyst types. Reduction using ammonia as a reagent in basic routes N(4)- N(7), was assumed to be present due to an increase in the reaction rates for reduced components (e.g. dinitrogen and N2O), when increasing the stoichiometric fraction of NH3 in the feed (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, from the analysis of the test data, correlations between the behaviour of certain components and the underlying mechanisms were brought together in a combination with what had been discussed in the literature to model the complex reactions taking place on the surface of the catalyst.",

My husband drove me to the hospital through the dark streets, and the whole time I tried not to feel the enormity of what we were doing: leaving ceremony for science, leaving home for a room built by people who did not imagine someone like me — Hopi, Purépecha, Indigenous, resistant — walking in with smoke and prayer. She didn’t flinch when I said that ceremony was part of my birth plan. We couldn’t smudge the entire surgical team — there are limits even the most generous doctor cannot bend — but she allowed me, my husband, and my doula to move slowly through the small pre-op room, lighting the bundle, letting the smoke rise over our heads. I didn’t plan to give birth in an operating room.",

This article also now includes recommendations on how to prevent people from accessing redacted information in PDFs after documents from the official Department of Justice Epstein Files dump were unredacted using a well-known and straightforward hack.*. Brian Krassenstein, political commentator and journalist, tweeted the day the DOJ released the latest batch of Epstein files, providing the evidence in a series of posts that showed the highly redacted documents as well as the unredacted versions, and explaining precisely how the Epstein files could be hacked. ## Epstein Files Document Hack Is Not The First PDF Redaction Failure Rodeo. Manafort’s response to the special counsel’s submission in support of its breach determination was redacted but, as reported by Wired at the time, “the redacted portions of the filing are “hidden” by black bars but can easily be revealed by simply highlighting those bars and copying and pasting the text into a new document.”.",

However, after losing to the San Antonio Spurs for the third time this season on Christmas Day, the conversation has quickly shifted, as the Thunder have struggled to contain the young star power. San Antonio has been led by the 7'5\" French superstar Victor Wembanyama, who has gotten the best of OKC's seven-footer, Chet Holmgren, in the three matchups. Thunder: San Antonio extends winning streak over OKC with blowout victory on Christmas Day**. Victor Wembanyama wants the smoke, he's ducking that smoke right now....Chet gotta come with it next time they play the Spurs, it might be in the postseason, but he gotta come with it, because right now the Spurs are pucking the Thunder and making them look soft,\" Perkins said on ESPN's 'Get Up'.

The fourth Ashes Test between Australia and England at the MCG was Test cricket cubism, the great game broken apart and stuck back together in abstract form, with a hint of Brydon Carse batting at number three. This is not a defence of the pitch which produced England's first Test win in this country for almost 15 years and the second two-day Test of the series. A year ago in Multan, Pakistan responded to being beaten by England on the flattest pitch imaginable by using the same pitch for the next Test, dried by industrial fans and garden heaters. The MCG has form for pitch problems in Tests where England have avoided an Ashes clean sweep. \"It's not the death of Test cricket at all,\" said Cook of the Boxing Day Test of 2025. Cook was playing the last time England won a Test in Australia, 5,468 days ago.",

            "content": "How does this report somehow find that refugees, a population with demonstrably higher welfare usage, outperform the average American fiscally? Of the welfare programs included, the study recognizes that usage by refugees and asylees is significantly higher than usage by the US population. Usage of Supplemental Security Income (SSI), the cash welfare program for the elderly and disabled, is nearly three times higher among refugees and asylees than among the general population (7.3% versus 2.6%). Most significantly, the report counts Social Security as welfare, and that program is used more by non-refugee Americans — because they have longer work histories than ­refugees. In the theoretical world of this study, a retiree who worked and paid taxes for 40 years and is now living solely off Social Security is a net fiscal drain on the government, while a working-age refugee receiving SNAP benefits with a modest taxable income would be counted as a net contributor.",

New York education officials reached out to Deborah Loewenberg Ball, a professor at the University of Michigan and director of TeachingWorks, to compile research on best practices for teaching numeracy ‒ the math counterpart of literacy ‒ into easily digestible guides that could be used by policymakers, school districts and teachers. The conflict has recently spawned entrenched camps like the Science of Math movement, which has criticized some of the teaching practices recommended by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and competing curricula like Illustrative Mathematics, an inquiry-based approach adopted in New York City and school districts in all 50 states. State test scores for public school students in New York City actually rose in the 2024-2025 school year, after Mayor Eric Adams overhauled the city's math curriculum, despite opposition from educators.",

Farmers ultimately paid for the Van Ness family’s hotel accommodation for seven months and approved a budget of $25,900 to have the home professionally cleaned — a fraction of what it would have cost to follow the advice of experts who insisted that the only way to remove the contaminants was to strip away every surface the smoke touched. The company did not address detailed questions from The Times about the contamination found inside the Van Ness home after the insurer-led remediation, or about the carcinogens detected in the family’s hair, saying that “we cannot comment on individual claims or customers.”.",

It indicates that the home is contaminated with potentially harmful chemicals derived from tobacco smoke,” explained Neal Benowitz, MD, a UC San Francisco professor emeritus of medicine and co-author of a recent paper on thirdhand smoke. The threat of thirdhand smoke exposure is similar to that of secondhand smoke exposure, an increased risk of cancer chief among them. “In mice, researchers have found that thirdhand smoke exposure causes DNA damage, can cause or promote cancer, cause immune dysfunction and behavior disturbances,” Benowitz told Medical Xpress. “Studies of people exposed to thirdhand smoke found changes in blood proteins that have been associated with inflammation and heart disease.”. He warned that the most at-risk populations include people with allergies and asthma, as well as children, “who crawl on the floor, can put objects contaminated with thirdhand smoke into their mouths, and can absorb it through the skin.”. While the threats are similar, thirdhand smoke behaves a bit differently from secondhand smoke — and may be more toxic.",
