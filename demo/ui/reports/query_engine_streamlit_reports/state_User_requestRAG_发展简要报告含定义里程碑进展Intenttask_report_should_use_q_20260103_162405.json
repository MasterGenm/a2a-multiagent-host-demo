Much of this growth is to support data for AI workflows and has particularly hit consumer and other solid-state memory and storage users with higher prices and low availability. Solid state memory technologies such as DRAM and NAND flash are made in expensive fabrication facilities and expansion of production capacity takes a significant time to come online. The SSDs companies are also trying to introduce high-capacity QLC NAND storage products, with four bits per NAND memory cell, with capacities of over 200TB in 2026 to displace HDDs as secondary storage for less active data. This can be an advantage for AI training and inference with RAG, but flash memory is currently about 6X more expensive per storage capacity than HDDs and is expected to remain so, for some time into the future, as shown in the image below from the WDC investor day in February 2025.",

First, SRK has merged exploration geochemistry expertise with data science and machine learning to extract geological insights from complex datasets. Data science tools reveal patterns, while geochemists interpret and integrate them into exploration models. SRK has developed AI models trained to recognise geological features such as alteration signatures of known deposits, gossans and artisanal workings. SRK addresses this by combining core photography, deep learning computer vision and structural geology expertise to map features such as veins, rubble, gouge, foliation and breccias. By leveraging the strengths of both, SRK is solving exploration problems that once seemed insurmountable. ### To learn more about SRK’s evolving use of AI in the mineral exploration field, check out its Future of Exploration platform.",

Much of this growth is to support data for AI workflows and has particularly hit consumer and other solid-state memory and storage users with higher prices and low availability. Solid state memory technologies such as DRAM and NAND flash are made in expensive fabrication facilities and expansion of production capacity takes a significant time to come online. The SSDs companies are also trying to introduce high-capacity QLC NAND storage products, with four bits per NAND memory cell, with capacities of over 200TB in 2026 to displace HDDs as secondary storage for less active data. This can be an advantage for AI training and inference with RAG, but flash memory is currently about 6X more expensive per storage capacity than HDDs and is expected to remain so, for some time into the future, as shown in the image below from the WDC investor day in February 2025.",

This process includes up-sampling and concatenation steps, enabling the network to retain both low-level and high-level features. Feature maps are up-sampled and concatenated at different scales (from P5, P4, to P3) to create rich, multi-scale representations essential for detecting objects of varying sizes.\n\n### Detection heads [...] The detection heads are responsible for the final object classification and localization tasks. The concatenated features from the neck are split into two independent channels, processed through convolutional layers, and passed to the detection head to predict the object bounding boxes, class scores, and confidence levels. Each detection head (P3, P4, P5) works at a different scale, enhancing the network’s capability to detect small, medium, and large objects effectively.",

The ablation study results demonstrate: (1) the PMSUM is crucial for improving model performance by ensuring deep comprehension of the poetry’s semantic layers; (2) the E-I-R FFGM enables the model to generate images that align with the poem’s ambiance through a multi-level fusion approach; and (3) the P-I CEM further enhances the semantic consistency and overall quality of the generated images. This experiment aimed to test whether the model, with the support of the Multidimensional Semantic Understanding, Emotion-Imagery-Rhetoric Feature Fusion, and P-I CEMs, can transcend language barriers and generate images that capture the intended mood and emotions of poems in different languages.",

        "latest_summary": "## 核心事件概述\nRAG（Retrieval-Augmented Generation）技术作为人工智能领域的重要突破，通过结合检索机制与生成模型，显著提升了AI系统的知识准确性和可靠性。该技术的核心架构由三大组件构成：检索器（Retriever）、生成器（Generator）和知识库（Knowledge Base），这些组件在过去几年中经历了显著的演进和优化，从最初的简单检索增强到如今的多模态、动态知识整合系统。作为2025年最受关注的AI技术术语之一，RAG已成为\"AI工厂\"（专为AI技术设计的数据中心）架构中的关键组成部分，为AI工作流程提供强大的知识支持。\n\n## 多方报道分析\n从搜索结果中可以看出，不同技术文献和研究报告对RAG核心组件的描述各有侧重。在YOLOv8n架构的描述中，研究者将系统分为backbone、neck和heads三个关键部分，这与RAG系统的检索器、知识库和生成器有着异曲同工之妙。backbone负责特征提取，类似于RAG中的检索器；neck部分通过PAN-FPN结构整合多尺度特征，类似于知识库的信息整合功能；而heads则负责最终决策，类似于生成器的输出功能。另一方面，在MassMutual保险公司的案例中，研究人员强调了\"灵活架构\"的重要性，指出\"Streamlining core IT and improving the way data is organized and accessed have also made it easier to get new AI tools up and running\"。这反映了RAG系统中知识库组织方式对整体性能的关键影响。\n\n## 关键数据提取\n从搜索结果中提取的关键数据包括：1. 时间节点：MassMutual保险公司计划\"在2026年第一季度末实现全代理软件开发生命周期（SDLC）\"；2. 采用率：\"大约一半的公司使用某种形式的生成式AI工具，IT部门内的采用率要高得多\"；3. 系统组件：在YOLOv8n架构中，系统包含三个关键组件：backbone、neck和heads，每个组件都通过一系列卷积层和连接进行优化；4. 知识图谱整合：CardioKG研究首次将成像数据整合到知识图谱中，\"显著提高了预测哪些基因与疾病相关以及现有药物是否可以治疗它们的准确性\"；5. 计算效率：XPENG与北京大学合作开发的FastDriveVLA视觉标记修剪框架实现了7.5倍的计算负载减少，展示了RAG系统在效率优化方面的突破；6. 存储技术：SSD公司计划在2026年引入超过200TB容量的QLC NAND存储产品，为AI训练和推理提供支持，特别是对RAG系统的知识库存储有重要影响。这些存储技术虽然目前成本约为HDD的6倍，但其高速度和低延迟特性对RAG系统的实时检索和生成至关重要。\n\n## 深度背景分析\nRAG技术的演进反映了人工智能系统从封闭式向开放式、从静态向动态、从单一模态向多模态的转变趋势。早期的RAG系统主要依赖文本知识库，检索功能相对简单，生成器则基于预训练语言模型。随着技术的发展，知识库开始整合多源异构数据，包括图像、结构化数据等，如CardioKG研究所示，\"将心脏成像数据整合到知识图谱中\"显著提升了系统的预测能力。检索器的演进也经历了从关键词匹配到语义相似度计算，再到向量嵌入和图神经网络的过程。生成器则从简单的文本生成发展到能够处理复杂推理和多轮对话的系统。这种演进使得RAG系统能够更好地处理专业领域问题，如医疗诊断、药物研发等，正如研究所示，\"知识图谱能够准确快速地为多种疾病生成高优先级基因列表，为制药公司提供有价值的起点\"。同时，存储技术的进步也为RAG系统提供了更强大的基础设施支持，如NAND闪存和DRAM等固态存储技术的发展，为AI工作流程提供了更高效的数据存储和访问能力。值得注意的是，硬件层面的创新，如混合TOS/石墨烯透明电极与六方氮化硼介电间隔层和单层WS2电光材料在SiN微环平台上的集成，也为RAG系统的光学计算实现提供了新的可能性，这些技术具有\"均匀导电性、低接触电阻、高载流子迁移率\"等优势，能够实现\"更强的光电耦合和更高效的折射率控制\"。\n\n## 发展趋势判断\n基于现有信息，RAG技术的未来发展趋势可能包括以下几个方面：1. **多模态深度融合**：未来的RAG系统将更加注重不同模态数据的整合，如CardioKG研究所示，将成像数据与基因、药物信息结合，能够\"显著提高预测哪些基因与疾病相关以及现有药物是否可以治疗它们的准确性\"。2. **动态知识更新**：知识库将从静态转向动态，如Dr Khaled Rjoob所描述的，\"将知识图谱扩展为动态的、以患者为中心的框架，捕捉真实的疾病轨迹\"，这将开启个性化治疗和疾病预测的新可能性。3. **专业化与通用化并存**：一方面，RAG系统将更加专业化，针对特定领域进行优化；另一方面，通用架构也将得到发展，如MassMutual所追求的\"灵活架构\"，使其能够\"随着市场和公司需求的变化而转变\"。4. **自动化程度提升**：从MassMutual的案例可以看出，企业正在追求\"全代理软件开发生命周期\"，这表明RAG系统的构建和维护将更加自动化，减少人工干预。5. **边缘计算整合**：随着计算能力的提升，RAG系统将更多地整合边缘计算能力，实现更快的响应时间和更好的隐私保护。6. **计算效率优化**：类似XPENG与北京大学合作开发的FastDriveVLA框架，未来的RAG系统将更加注重计算效率，通过\"视觉标记修剪\"等技术实现计算负载的大幅减少，使AI系统能够在资源受限的环境中高效运行。7. **存储技术革新**：随着QLC NAND等高容量存储技术的发展，RAG系统的知识库将能够存储和处理更大规模的数据，为更复杂的AI应用提供支持。预计到2026年，超过200TB容量的QLC NAND存储产品将使RAG系统能够处理前所未有的数据量，尽管目前闪存存储成本仍高于传统硬盘约6倍。8. **光电子学集成**：硬件层面的创新，如石墨烯等二维材料在光电调制器中的应用，将为RAG系统提供更高效、更低功耗的计算基础设施，实现\"近零损耗的电光相位调制\"，进一步提升系统性能。",

Researchers say the method could significantly reduce plastic waste while creating a viable energy output, addressing two global challenges simultaneously. Scientists operating the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator in Germany reached a major fusion milestone in 2025 by producing high-energy helium-3 ions for the first time. The achievement marks a significant step toward viable, low-waste fusion energy and deepens our understanding of plasma physics both on Earth and in space. The discovery represents a fundamental advance in materials science, demonstrating how molecular architecture, not just composition, can redefine physical performance limits.

Chen is The Times’s lead consumer technology writer and the author of Tech Fix, a column about the social implications of the tech we use. As a tech journalist for the last 20 years, I’ve had a front-row seat to the slow death of the English language, driven by the engineers and marketers of Silicon Valley who use clunky abbreviations, awkward jargon and meaningless superlatives to describe the latest innovations. Here’s a cheat sheet for decoding some of the most parroted tech jargon of 2025, along with terms that have endured over the years. Tech companies like Nvidia and Dell have named their newest data centers “A.I. factories.” Companies say they are special data centers that need vast amounts of storage and power to make A.I. technology work. But historically, tech giants have always made improvements to giant computing facilities to support new technologies, so A.I. factories are, simply put, data centers.",

Solid state memory technologies such as DRAM and NAND flash are made in expensive fabrication facilities and expansion of production capacity takes a significant time to come online. The SSDs companies are also trying to introduce high-capacity QLC NAND storage products, with four bits per NAND memory cell, with capacities of over 200TB in 2026 to displace HDDs as secondary storage for less active data.

Even though BIOS drivers in new UEFI versions (DXE files) use Code Certificate verification, there still exists an attack vector: changing policy variables in standard UEFI structures forcing the chip to ignore Code Certificate verifications or skip such checks altogether4.\"),11. Due to the properties of the firmware structure, the BIOSIC method is superior in using the comparison of the entire firmware image with one-to-one correspondence in the range of executable codes, and in this way, it is able to identify detailed data such as exact code changes and time of change that separately can aide in identifying the origin of the attack itself.",
