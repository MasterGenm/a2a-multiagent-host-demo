Michigan Ross built a teaching assistant that guides students through reasoning. Penn State’s MyResource helps students navigate advising and services 24/7. These aren’t novelty deployments; they’re early evidence that governed agents can measurably reduce bottlenecks in advising, enrollment, learning support, and operational coordination.

Students have already integrated AI into daily academic workflows, vendors are pushing enterprise deployments, federal and accreditation expectations are rising, and labor-market volatility is forcing colleges to rethink how learning connects to opportunity.

Miller, an assistant professor of management at Doane, said the class models for students how to best use AI as a tool in an ethical way, while also demonstrating the limits to the rapidly spreading technology. “It’s not all about AI,” Miller said. While nearly half of the survey's respondents said they felt inadequately prepared for an AI-enabled workforce, Doane students in Miller's class said the opposite. While Doane students said the experience of training an AI bot to solve a problem for a client has helped them prepare for their future careers, students at Nebraska Wesleyan University are using AI to simulate the dynamics of a group therapy session. Both students said the AI bot's ability to better help them understand concepts has been surprising.",

On top of that, AI adoption has created a demand for workers that are more than simply comfortable with AI tools, and has led to the development of new tools through which L&D is done. Since AI is changing how people work, it’s a new priority for HR efforts at many organizations. If a company is using AI, employees will need guidance in how to work with those changes — changes they may not be comfortable with. One of those new AI-enabled technologies is immersive learning, like with virtual reality simulations “that put people in realistic situations,” said Ayers. Overall, AI is helping L&D leaders create different avenues for how to train people as well as provide opportunities to people where they are, she added, whether that’s through more traditional methods of learning and development, online courses or simulations.",

The report cites a Berkeley-led study documenting 100-plus real-world AI use cases in legal aid, “including ratings, recommendations, and estimates of efficiency gains.” However, pricing is once again a barrier, and “high subscription costs for the best and most reliable legal AI tools might make those tools unaffordable and inaccessible to the access-to-justice community.”.

SU, Le Moyne and OCC either encourage or require professors to decide how they want students to use AI. Multiple professors said they see students upload class slides or paste class notes into a chatbot and ask it to create study tools like a practice quiz or study questions.

            "content": "AI translation technology’s use expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic as schools sought ways to stay connected with multilingual families, says Sophie Othman, an associate language education and technology professor at the University of Marie and Louis Pasteur in France. “Tools like Microsoft Translator and education-specific platforms allow teachers to communicate with multilingual families in real time,” Othman says. “When the students join the conversation, they select their language,” he says. It will translate what they say into English.”. As I’m speaking, it’s translating,” she says. Washington’s Bellevue School District uses technologies from a variety of providers for translation purposes, including Microsoft Copilot and a platform that lets families receive and respond to texts in their preferred language, according to Ricardo Macias, director of community outreach. “We use AI for translation, mostly for communication with families, email and things like that,” Macias says. While the district has gotten some constructive feedback suggesting translated documents weren’t always 100% accurate, Macias believes that with regular use, AI-based language tools can help strengthen schools’ correspondence**.**.",
