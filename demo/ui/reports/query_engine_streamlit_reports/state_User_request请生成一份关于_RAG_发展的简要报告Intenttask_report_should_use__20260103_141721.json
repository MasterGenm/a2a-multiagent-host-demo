Chen is The Times’s lead consumer technology writer and the author of Tech Fix, a column about the social implications of the tech we use. As a tech journalist for the last 20 years, I’ve had a front-row seat to the slow death of the English language, driven by the engineers and marketers of Silicon Valley who use clunky abbreviations, awkward jargon and meaningless superlatives to describe the latest innovations. Here’s a cheat sheet for decoding some of the most parroted tech jargon of 2025, along with terms that have endured over the years. Tech companies like Nvidia and Dell have named their newest data centers “A.I. factories.” Companies say they are special data centers that need vast amounts of storage and power to make A.I. technology work. But historically, tech giants have always made improvements to giant computing facilities to support new technologies, so A.I. factories are, simply put, data centers.",

Much of this growth is to support data for AI workflows and has particularly hit consumer and other solid-state memory and storage users with higher prices and low availability. Solid state memory technologies such as DRAM and NAND flash are made in expensive fabrication facilities and expansion of production capacity takes a significant time to come online. The SSDs companies are also trying to introduce high-capacity QLC NAND storage products, with four bits per NAND memory cell, with capacities of over 200TB in 2026 to displace HDDs as secondary storage for less active data. This can be an advantage for AI training and inference with RAG, but flash memory is currently about 6X more expensive per storage capacity than HDDs and is expected to remain so, for some time into the future, as shown in the image below from the WDC investor day in February 2025.",

[Metroid Prime 4: Beyond developer]. ## Comments (2). I know the Prime games were rather loose about \"metroid control\", and it appears Metroid Prime 4 is no different. Prime 3 -> Fed Force -> Beginning of Prime 4 -> Lamorn Artifact Incident -> Rest of Prime 4 (set between Super Metroid/Fusion).",

SSA achieves global optimization in the parameter space through the synergistic interaction of three functional categories: discoverers, scroungers and investigation early warning mechanism. However, SSA has the problems of insufficient ability, loss of population diversity, and easy to fall into local extremes in the later stage of optimization. [...] In summary, the SCSSA algorithm integrates the adaptive adjustment mechanism of the SCA, the initialization strategy of the refractive reverse learning, and the global disturbance ability of the Cauchy mutation.

DeepSeek combined various techniques to minimize the extra cost of training a model, Sun said. \"The willingness to share important findings with the industry while continuing to deliver unique value through new models showcases a newfound confidence in the Chinese AI industry,\" Su said of DeepSeek's paper. The paper comes as DeepSeek is reportedly working toward the release of its next flagship model R2, following an earlier postponement. DeepSeek previously published foundational training research ahead of its R1 model launch. Business Insider's Alistair Barr wrote in June that DeepSeek's updates to its R1 model failed to generate much traction in the tech industry.",

Chen is The Times’s lead consumer technology writer and the author of Tech Fix, a column about the social implications of the tech we use. As a tech journalist for the last 20 years, I’ve had a front-row seat to the slow death of the English language, driven by the engineers and marketers of Silicon Valley who use clunky abbreviations, awkward jargon and meaningless superlatives to describe the latest innovations. Here’s a cheat sheet for decoding some of the most parroted tech jargon of 2025, along with terms that have endured over the years. Tech companies like Nvidia and Dell have named their newest data centers “A.I. factories.” Companies say they are special data centers that need vast amounts of storage and power to make A.I. technology work. But historically, tech giants have always made improvements to giant computing facilities to support new technologies, so A.I. factories are, simply put, data centers.",

Much of this growth is to support data for AI workflows and has particularly hit consumer and other solid-state memory and storage users with higher prices and low availability. Solid state memory technologies such as DRAM and NAND flash are made in expensive fabrication facilities and expansion of production capacity takes a significant time to come online. The SSDs companies are also trying to introduce high-capacity QLC NAND storage products, with four bits per NAND memory cell, with capacities of over 200TB in 2026 to displace HDDs as secondary storage for less active data. This can be an advantage for AI training and inference with RAG, but flash memory is currently about 6X more expensive per storage capacity than HDDs and is expected to remain so, for some time into the future, as shown in the image below from the WDC investor day in February 2025.",

Meanwhile, the U.S. has committed just $1.2 billion (about 2 percent of the worldwide total), leaving much of America’s progress in the hands of private innovators like SEEQC (pronounced ‘seek,’ short for Scalable Energy Efficient Quantum Computing). But SEEQC isn’t just fueling Big Tech’s ambitions; their quantum-on-a-chip approach represents an entirely new computing architecture, one that merges quantum and classical computing into a single plane — harnessing the power of both, side by side. John Levy, co-founder and CEO of SEEQC, is leading the effort to make quantum computing smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient. SEEQC’s chip-based system replaces racks of analog electronics and complex wiring with an integrated digital processor, making quantum computing compact and scalable.",
