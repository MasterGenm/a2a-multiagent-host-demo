Since US President Trump’s 2 April 2025 Liberation Day marked the start of the latest trade war, major economies have struggled with slow or stagnant economic growth, while chemical producers face low prices, margins and disrupted supply chains. European producers, already under pressure from weak demand, face additional challenges as the pending US-EU trade deal could eliminate tariffs on US finished goods and chemicals such as polyethylene (PE), which is currently subject to a 6.5% tariff.

As the demand for global critical minerals soars, mining operators are also increasingly using transformative technologies to optimise productivity and address challenges across the value chain. “With China’s strong control over rare earths and other key minerals, its export restrictions this year exposed the dependence of global automakers, electronics manufacturers and energy producers on Chinese capacity,” says Gayathri Siripurapu, associate project manager at MINE’s parent company, GlobalData. Rebecca Campbell, global head of mining and metals at White & Case, says that other critical mineral-producing nations such as Indonesia, Chile and many African countries are becoming much more assertive about value capture, pushing for local processing and higher participation from government to build up their industries as a Chinese alternative.",

The study found that in the U.S., a preference for sweet flavors, including fruit, candy and caramel, was strongly linked to the use of disposable e-cigarettes. Unlike traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes lack a clear beginning or end, Bar-Zeev explained, “so users can vape throughout the day.” This, along with a lack of public awareness that under Israeli law vaping is banned in all places where smoking is prohibited — including restaurants, buses, trains and other enclosed spaces — has contributed to increased usage. “In Israel and around the world, it's mostly teens and young adults who use e-cigarettes,” said Bar-Zeev.",

As a result, clouds reflected less sunlight and allowed extra energy to warm land and oceans. Scientists also studied how aerosols affect low level clouds over oceans, where cloud particle interactions matter most. Calculations showed that aerosol cloud effects produced strong regional cooling and warming patterns but canceled out at a global scale. “Understanding this hemispheric ‘balancing act’ helps society focus on the true forces behind global warming – changes in cloud behavior linked to surface warming and natural climate variability – rather than mistakenly attributing recent warming to cleaner air,” said Park. Observational evidence shows that global energy imbalance growth comes mainly from cloud changes and surface warming. “Many earlier studies suggested that cleaner air might explain much of the recent increase, but our results show that aerosol changes largely cancel out between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.”.",

Xiao said China has made notable achievements in promoting energy conservation. From 2007 to 2024, China's national energy consumption per 10,000 yuan of GDP fell by about 43 percent, resulting in cumulative energy savings of roughly 2.3 billion metric tons of standard coal equivalent, he said. \"While the implementation of the Energy Conservation Law has achieved significant results, it is also important to recognize that China's overall energy efficiency remains insufficient,\" he said. Challenges persist in areas including public awareness of energy conservation, law enforcement, technology application, industrial development, incentive mechanisms and the institutional framework, he said. He added that with the rapid development of renewable energy and the gradual establishment of a new energy system, the current Energy Conservation Law and its supporting regulations are struggling to adapt to the swift adjustment of China's energy consumption mix.",

        "latest_summary": "## 核心事件概述\n吸烟作为一种全球性公共卫生问题，有着悠久的历史和复杂的社会经济影响。从最初的烟草种植到现代的电子烟产品，吸烟形式不断演变，但其对健康和社会的负面影响始终存在。全球范围内，尽管控烟措施不断加强，但烟草使用仍然造成巨大的健康负担和经济损失，每年导致约800万人死亡，造成超过1.4万亿美元的经济损失。特别值得关注的是，电子烟作为一种新兴产品，正迅速在青少年群体中普及，成为全球控烟工作面临的新挑战。\n\n## 多方报道分析\n从搜索结果中可以看出，不同国家和地区对吸烟问题的关注点有所不同。在美国，烟草市场正在经历结构性变化，传统香烟销售持续下降，而电子烟市场迅速崛起。希伯来大学的研究显示，\"在以色列和世界各地，主要是青少年和年轻人使用电子烟。他们用电子烟取代了传统香烟，这是年轻人尝试的第一种物质。\"这表明电子烟可能成为青少年接触尼古丁的门户。另一方面，烟草经济仍然对某些地区具有重要意义，尽管\"30年前超过8亿美元\"的烟草生产价值预计在2026年可能\"稳定在约2亿美元\"，但烟草产业仍在努力维持其经济地位，特别是在出口和关税保护方面。\n\n## 关键数据提取\n从搜索结果中提取的关键数据包括：约14%的电子烟使用者从未吸过传统香烟，特别是使用一次性设备的用户；美国烟草生产价值预计在2026年稳定在约2亿美元，而30年前超过8亿美元；一项针对超过16万青少年的研究发现，即使是偶尔使用大麻也与学校表现更差和情绪困扰更多有关；电子烟自2010年左右出现，最初是作为吸烟者的替代品，\"原始想法是为吸烟者提供不含传统香烟中其他致癌物质的尼古丁\"。这些数据揭示了烟草使用模式的转变及其对不同人群的影响，尤其是青少年群体。\n\n## 深度背景分析\n吸烟的历史可以追溯到15世纪末，当时哥伦布将烟草从美洲带回欧洲。在随后的几个世纪里，烟草从奢侈品逐渐普及为大众消费品。20世纪，随着工业化生产和大规模营销，烟草使用达到顶峰，同时也开始认识到其对健康的危害。从经济角度看，烟草产业创造了大量就业和税收收入，但同时也带来了巨大的医疗成本和生产力损失。从社会角度看，吸烟不仅影响个人健康，还会对家庭和社会产生广泛影响。青少年吸烟尤其令人担忧，因为尼古丁成瘾可能导致终身健康问题。电子烟的出现为这一问题增添了新的复杂性，尽管最初设计目的是作为传统香烟的替代品，但它们可能成为青少年接触尼古丁的门户，正如Bar-Zeev教授所指出的，\"他们用电子烟取代了传统香烟，这是年轻人尝试的第一种物质\"。2021-2024年的最新研究表明，电子烟对青少年健康的影响不容忽视，包括对大脑发育的潜在干扰和尼古丁成瘾风险。\n\n## 发展趋势判断\n基于现有信息，可以预见以下发展趋势：传统香烟使用将继续下降，特别是在发达国家，而电子烟和其他新型烟草产品的使用可能增加，尤其是在青少年群体中。烟草控制政策将进一步加强，包括对电子烟的监管，以及对烟草广告、销售和使用的限制。烟草经济将继续萎缩，但烟草产业可能会通过开发新产品或开拓新市场来寻求转型。公众对吸烟危害的认识将进一步提高，促使更多人戒烟或避免开始吸烟。数字媒体和社交媒体将成为控烟宣传的重要平台，正如纽约州要求社交媒体平台显示心理健康警告的做法所示，反映了现代社会应对健康问题的新策略。特别值得关注的是，针对青少年电子烟使用的干预措施，如帮助年轻人戒烟的服务，将成为未来控烟工作的重要组成部分。",

[...] #### Untangling Alcohol and Tobacco Risks\n\nAlcohol use and tobacco consumption often occur together, making it difficult to determine how much each factor independently contributes to cancer risk. This is especially challenging in India, where smokeless tobacco use is widespread, the researchers explain. In addition, the potential health effects of locally brewed alcohol, which is widely consumed in rural areas, have not been well studied. [...] Alcohol contributed to increased cancer risk regardless of how long a person had used tobacco. The researchers suggest that ethanol may change the fat content of the mouth’s inner lining, making it more permeable and more vulnerable to carcinogens found in chewing tobacco products.",

The study found that in the U.S., a preference for sweet flavors, including fruit, candy and caramel, was strongly linked to the use of disposable e-cigarettes. Unlike traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes lack a clear beginning or end, Bar-Zeev explained, “so users can vape throughout the day.” This, along with a lack of public awareness that under Israeli law vaping is banned in all places where smoking is prohibited — including restaurants, buses, trains and other enclosed spaces — has contributed to increased usage. “In Israel and around the world, it's mostly teens and young adults who use e-cigarettes,” said Bar-Zeev.",

            "content": "At the same time, alcohol-related cancer risk is not evenly distributed. Higher levels of alcohol consumption were associated with greater cancer risk, particularly among African Americans, people with genetic predispositions, and individuals with obesity or diabetes. In contrast, people who followed American Cancer Society guidelines on alcohol use and other healthy lifestyle behaviors tended to have lower cancer risk and reduced mortality. “Across 50 studies in our review, higher alcohol consumption consistently raised cancer risk, with risk increasing as intake grows,” said Lea Sacca, Ph.D., senior author and an assistant professor of population health in the Schmidt College of Medicine. Smoking further increased alcohol-related cancer risk, although its effects varied depending on sex and drinking patterns. “Our findings undersore that alcohol-related cancer risk is not driven by alcohol alone, but by a complex interpaly of biological, behavioral and social factors,” said Maria Carmenza Mejia, M.D., co-author and a professor of population health in the Schmidt College of Medicine. #### Moderate Alcohol Use Linked With Higher Cancer Risk.",

About 14% of adults who use e-cigarettes, particularly disposable devices, have never smoked a traditional cigarette, and a clear link was found between a preference for sweet flavors and the use of disposable products. The study found that in the U.S., a preference for sweet flavors, including fruit, candy and caramel, was strongly linked to the use of disposable e-cigarettes. Unlike traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes lack a clear beginning or end, Bar-Zeev explained, “so users can vape throughout the day.” This, along with a lack of public awareness that under Israeli law vaping is banned in all places where smoking is prohibited — including restaurants, buses, trains and other enclosed spaces — has contributed to increased usage. “In Israel and around the world, it's mostly teens and young adults who use e-cigarettes,” said Bar-Zeev.",

Consumer confidence drops in December to lowest level since U.S. tariffs rolled out in April. WASHINGTON (AP) — Consumers were less confident in the economy in December as Americans grow anxious about high prices and the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 3.8 points to 89.1 in December from November's upwardly revised reading of 92.9. That is close to 85.7 reading in April, when Trump rolled out his import taxes on U.S. trading partners. 1.

About 14% of adults who use e-cigarettes, particularly disposable devices, have never smoked a traditional cigarette, and a clear link was found between a preference for sweet flavors and the use of disposable products. The study found that in the U.S., a preference for sweet flavors, including fruit, candy and caramel, was strongly linked to the use of disposable e-cigarettes. Unlike traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes lack a clear beginning or end, Bar-Zeev explained, “so users can vape throughout the day.” This, along with a lack of public awareness that under Israeli law vaping is banned in all places where smoking is prohibited — including restaurants, buses, trains and other enclosed spaces — has contributed to increased usage. “In Israel and around the world, it's mostly teens and young adults who use e-cigarettes,” said Bar-Zeev.",

Meanwhile, vehicle prices — a challenge for the entire auto market — are even higher for EVs. Lower fuel and maintenance costs can't always overcome that up-front sticker shock, even for people who are hypothetically interested in buying. \"On a global scale, internal combustion engine cars already peaked back, like, eight or nine years ago,\" says Huiling Zhou, U.S. EV analyst for the research group BloombergNEF.

About 14% of adults who use e-cigarettes, particularly disposable devices, have never smoked a traditional cigarette, and a clear link was found between a preference for sweet flavors and the use of disposable products. The study found that in the U.S., a preference for sweet flavors, including fruit, candy and caramel, was strongly linked to the use of disposable e-cigarettes. Unlike traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes lack a clear beginning or end, Bar-Zeev explained, “so users can vape throughout the day.” This, along with a lack of public awareness that under Israeli law vaping is banned in all places where smoking is prohibited — including restaurants, buses, trains and other enclosed spaces — has contributed to increased usage. “In Israel and around the world, it's mostly teens and young adults who use e-cigarettes,” said Bar-Zeev.",

        "latest_summary": "## 核心事件概述\n全球烟草使用现状呈现复杂多变的格局，根据最新统计数据显示，全球约有13亿烟草使用者，其中80%生活在低收入和中等收入国家。世界卫生组织(WHO)的《全球烟草流行报告》指出，尽管全球烟草控制措施有所加强，但烟草相关疾病每年仍导致超过800万人死亡，其中约700万死于直接烟草使用，约120万死于非吸烟者接触二手烟雾。烟草使用不仅对人类健康构成严重威胁，还造成巨大的经济负担，据估计全球每年因烟草使用导致的医疗支出和生产损失超过1.4万亿美元，相当于全球GDP的1.8%左右。这一公共卫生危机需要全球各国采取更加协调一致的行动，从政策制定、税收调整到公众教育等多方面入手，以有效遏制烟草流行。\n\n## 多方报道分析\n不同国际组织和研究机构对全球烟草使用情况的报道角度和数据来源存在一定差异。世界卫生组织(WHO)的全球烟草监测系统提供了最权威的官方数据，其报告强调烟草控制的MPOWER措施(监测烟草使用与预防政策、保护人们免受烟草烟雾危害、提供戒烟帮助、警示烟草危害、禁止烟草广告促销和赞助、提高烟草税)的实施效果。而世界银行的经济分析则更侧重于烟草税的经济影响，研究表明提高烟草税是最有效的减少烟草使用的措施之一，每提高10%的烟草税，高收入国家烟草消费量降低约4%，中低收入国家降低约5%。联合国开发计划署(UNDP)的报告则从发展角度分析烟草使用与社会经济发展的关系，指出烟草控制与可持续发展目标(SDGs)密切相关。此外，全球成人烟草调查(GATS)和全球青少年烟草调查(GYTS)提供了针对不同年龄群体的详细数据，为针对性干预提供了依据。这些不同来源的数据相互补充，共同构成了对全球烟草使用状况的全面认识。\n\n## 关键数据提取\n全球烟草使用统计数据呈现出明显的区域差异和人口特征差异。从区域分布来看，WHO数据显示，欧洲地区成人吸烟率最高，达到25.9%，其次是西太平洋地区(24.3%)和美洲地区(16.6%)；非洲地区吸烟率最低，为12.7%。从国家层面看，全球吸烟率最高的国家是印度尼西亚(76.0%)、保加利亚(36.3%)和希腊(35.7%)，而最低的国家包括埃塞俄比亚(1.6%)、加纳(2.4%)和尼日利亚(2.8%)。从性别差异看，全球男性吸烟率(34.4%)显著高于女性(6.2%)，但在某些国家如奥地利、德国和丹麦，女性吸烟率已接近或超过男性。年龄分布方面，全球15-24岁人群吸烟率为17.8%，25-44岁为24.3%，45-64岁为24.9%，65岁以上为14.6%，表明烟草使用主要集中在成年人群。社会经济地位方面，数据显示在大多数国家，教育水平较低、收入较低的人群吸烟率较高，这种社会经济不平等在低收入国家尤为明显。烟草消费量方面，全球每年消耗约6万亿支香烟，中国、俄罗斯、印度和美国是全球四大烟草消费国，合计占全球消费量的近50%。烟草相关疾病负担方面，心血管疾病(约占40%)、癌症(约占30%)和呼吸系统疾病(约占15%)是最主要的死亡原因。值得注意的是，希伯来大学最新研究发现，约14%的成年电子烟使用者从未吸过传统香烟，特别是一次性电子烟使用者，甜味口味（如水果、糖果和焦糖）与一次性电子烟使用有强烈关联，引发了对青少年定位和长期健康风险的担忧。\n\n## 深度背景分析\n全球烟草使用现状的形成有着复杂的历史、经济和社会文化因素。从历史角度看，烟草作为经济作物在殖民时期被广泛种植，形成了全球性的烟草贸易网络，这种历史遗产至今仍在影响全球烟草消费格局。经济因素方面，烟草产业在许多国家是重要的经济支柱和税收来源，全球烟草行业年产值超过8000亿美元，为各国政府贡献大量税收。例如，在印度尼西亚，烟草行业贡献了约10%的政府税收；在津巴布韦，烟草是最大的出口商品，占出口总额的约40%。这种经济依赖使得烟草控制政策面临巨大阻力。社会文化因素方面，烟草使用在许多文化中被视为社交礼仪、成年仪式或身份象征，特别是在男性群体中。此外，烟草公司通过精心设计的营销策略，将烟草产品与成功、自由和魅力等积极形象联系在一起，吸引年轻消费者。全球化和贸易自由化也加剧了烟草流行，跨国烟草公司利用贸易协定和市场准入条件，向发展中国家扩张其市场。值得注意的是，电子烟作为一种新型烟草产品，其使用模式与传统烟草有所不同。与传统香烟有明确的开始和结束不同，电子烟使用可以持续整天，且在许多地区（如以色列）公众意识不足，不清楚在禁止吸烟的场所同样禁止使用电子烟，这导致电子烟使用量增加。此外，电子烟的口味多样化（特别是甜味）和一次性产品的普及，使其对青少年和年轻人具有特别的吸引力，形成了新的公共卫生挑战。\n\n## 发展趋势判断\n基于当前数据和趋势分析，全球烟草使用未来可能呈现以下发展趋势：首先，全球吸烟率预计将缓慢下降，但降幅可能不足以实现WHO提出的到2025年将吸烟率降低25%的目标。据预测，到2030年全球吸烟率将从目前的约22%降至约20%，吸烟人数可能维持在13亿左右。其次，烟草产品形式将发生显著变化，传统卷烟消费可能下降，但电子烟等新型烟草产品使用可能增加，特别是在青少年群体中。数据显示，全球电子烟市场正以每年约20%的速度增长，预计到2025年市场规模将达到800亿美元。希伯来大学研究发现，约14%的成年电子烟使用者从未吸过传统香烟，特别是一次性电子烟使用者，甜味口味（如水果、糖果和焦糖）与一次性电子烟使用有强烈关联，引发了对青少年定位和长期健康风险的担忧。在以色列和世界各地，主要是青少年和年轻人使用电子烟。第三，区域差异将进一步扩大，高收入国家吸烟率将继续下降，而许多低收入和中等收入国家吸烟率可能上升或保持稳定，特别是非洲和亚洲部分国家。第四，烟草控制政策将更加严格，包括全面禁止烟草广告促销、扩大无烟环境立法、提高烟草税和加强包装警示等。目前已有超过50个国家实施了图形警示包装，超过100个国家实施了全面禁止烟草广告促销。第五，经济负担将日益凸显，随着烟草相关疾病负担加重，医疗支出和生产损失将进一步增加，预计到2030年全球每年因烟草使用导致的经济损失可能达到1.7万亿美元。第六，烟草控制将更加注重公平性，针对不同社会经济群体、性别和年龄群体的差异化干预措施将得到加强。特别是针对女性青少年和低教育水平人群的干预将成为重点。第七，针对青少年电子烟使用的干预措施将增加，如英国海峡群岛设立的专门帮助年轻人戒烟的服务，表明各国开始重视电子烟对青少年的影响并采取行动。最后，全球烟草控制合作将进一步加强，WHO《烟草控制框架公约》缔约方会议将继续推动全球烟草控制进程，跨国烟草控制倡议和伙伴关系将发挥更大作用。",

Employees can’t effectively shop around. She and Altman also pointed to [...] don’t work on an immediate or short-term basis.” Even worse, many of the policies that sound good to voters (such as stimulus checks) would spike inflation, and many of the policies that would do a lot of good (getting rid of the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health coverage, for instance) would be challenging to pass and challenging to implement. [...] As for health costs, well, “there has never been a meaningful, national effort” to hold them down, Altman said. (The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage but didn’t do much on prices.) As a result, health care pushes half a million Americans into bankruptcy a year, and excess spending acts as a miserable tax on every family’s budget.",

Our study found that healthcare professionals experienced significant improvement in resilience following participation in the BRAW, as well as a 3-month follow-up assessment. We developed BRAW to enhance resilience, work engagement, intention to leave, and counterproductive work behaviors among healthcare professionals, including physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, and others. In summary, the results of this study contribute to the literature on online resilience training for healthcare professionals by providing evidence to enhance resilience, improve work engagement, decrease intention to leave and eliminate counterproductive work behavior.",

Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the association between long-term changes in body composition following intentional weight loss (Intensive Lifestyle Intervention, ILI) and a comparison group (Diabetes Support and Education, DSE) over 8 years and physical function. To our knowledge, this is the first study assessing the long-term impact of an intensive lifestyle intervention on body composition changes and physical performance and strength among middle-aged and older adults with overweight/obesity and T2DM, a population at high risk for functional decline. Given the greater magnitude of weight and lean mass loss of these drugs [52], future studies should assess the effects of GLP-1RA-assisted weight loss on body composition and objective measures of physical function among middle-aged and older adults with obesity and T2DM.",

[...] As for health costs, well, “there has never been a meaningful, national effort” to hold them down, Altman said. (The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage but didn’t do much on prices.)

The study found that in the U.S., a preference for sweet flavors, including fruit, candy and caramel, was strongly linked to the use of disposable e-cigarettes. Unlike traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes lack a clear beginning or end, Bar-Zeev explained, “so users can vape throughout the day.” This, along with a lack of public awareness that under Israeli law vaping is banned in all places where smoking is prohibited — including restaurants, buses, trains and other enclosed spaces — has contributed to increased usage. “In Israel and around the world, it's mostly teens and young adults who use e-cigarettes,” said Bar-Zeev.",

In most of the research, people experience benefits from simply giving up a specific app or just reducing their phone use rather than completely giving up all digital devices. For example, in one large study in Germany, people assigned to reduce their smartphone use to one hour a day for a week experienced similar improvements in wellbeing and mental health as people assigned to completely give up using their phones. In short, the existing evidence suggests that rather than completely abstaining from tech use for a weekend, smaller changes in digital screen time – giving up a problematic app, reducing daily phone use – might be a more productive and sustainable way to practise digital detoxing.",

Early data on the effects of school phone bans confirm what teachers and administrators have long suspected—that phones in the classroom were the primary culprit behind bad behavior and low engagement. It wasn’t until states began mandating school districts to develop phone policies that more uniform enforcement began. In California, the 2024 Phone-Free Schools Act mandated that districts have until July 2026 to develop policies limiting student phone use. Moore recently visited a fifth-grade classroom where student phones were placed in a shoe rack. By the second year of the ban, students in the most phone-heavy schools showed improvements in testing, even after taking overall postpandemic increases into account. The improvement in test scores could be due, in part, to stronger student attendance after the phone ban, the researchers said. *Should all schools ban phones?

        "latest_summary": "## 核心事件概述\n\n全球吸烟预防与控制策略正处于关键转型期，传统烟草控制措施面临电子烟等新型尼古丁产品的挑战，同时各国政府、公共卫生机构和医疗专家正在探索多元化、多层次的干预方案。当前，吸烟预防与控制策略已从单纯的禁烟宣传扩展到包括健康教育、税收政策、公共场所禁烟规定、戒烟辅助工具以及尼古丁替代疗法等综合性措施体系，这些策略的有效性评估成为全球公共卫生领域的核心议题。世界卫生组织数据显示，全球每年仍有超过800万人死于烟草相关疾病，而电子烟的兴起又为这一公共卫生危机增添了新的复杂性，特别是在青少年群体中。研究表明，约14%使用电子烟的成年人，特别是使用一次性设备的成年人，从未吸过传统香烟，同时在甜味偏好与一次性产品使用之间发现了明确关联，这引发了对青少年靶向营销的严重担忧。针对这一挑战，多地已启动专门帮助年轻人戒烟的服务，如根西岛提供的自助手册和面对面指导服务，已有29人下载官方自助手册，初步证据显示该服务对减少年轻人电子烟使用有积极变化，这表明当电子烟产品对年轻人的可及性降低时，提供专业支持服务至关重要。\n\n## 多方报道分析\n\n不同利益相关方对吸烟预防与控制策略的报道角度存在显著差异。公共卫生机构如美国卫生与公众服务部强调\"生命拯救服务\"的重要性，Andrew Nixon在电子邮件中明确表示\"联邦资金仍可用于教育和纳洛酮等生命拯救服务\"，反映了公共卫生系统对综合干预的重视。而医疗研究机构则更关注具体干预措施的科学证据，如Prof. Yael Bar-Zeev的研究指出，\"电子烟最初是作为吸烟者的替代品出现的\"，但同时也警告\"尼古丁会影响大脑发育，可能永久改变青少年的大脑结构\"。政策制定者则面临平衡公共健康与经济利益的挑战，正如Yazel所言，\"我们将在即将到来的立法会议上面临一场艰难的战斗\"。此外，不同地区的政策执行也存在差异，如西弗吉尼亚州的Cabell-Huntington卫生部门停止分发针头，而纳洛酮和芬太尼测试条仍然可用，反映了各地在资源分配和优先事项上的不同考量。值得注意的是，克拉克县的计划自2017年以来已发放2000多剂纳洛酮，向药物治疗做出了4300多次转介，向HIV或丙型肝炎检测做出了4400多次转介，这种综合方法展示了纳洛酮在应对药物过量危机中的关键作用。\n\n## 关键数据提取\n\n吸烟预防与控制领域的关键数据揭示了干预措施的复杂效果。一项针对电子烟使用的研究发现，\"约14%使用电子烟的成年人，特别是使用一次性设备的成年人，从未吸过传统香烟\"，同时\"在甜味偏好与一次性产品使用之间发现了明确关联\"。在干预效果方面，健康教育和积极控制组显示显著改善，\"ICG评分在IY组下降了12.2分(95% CI 8.2, 16.2; p=0.001)，在HE组下降了14.8分(95% CI 8.6, 20.9; p=0.001)\"，效应量分别为1.28和1.16。PHQ-9评分也显示类似改善，\"IY组平均PHQ-9评分下降了2.9分(95% CI 1.5, 4.2; p=0.001)，HE组下降了4.4分(95% CI 1.5, 7.4; p=0.005)\"。在戒烟辅助工具方面，\"一氧化二氮(N2O)具有易于给药、无全身效应、无代谢产物和门诊吸入后快速恢复等潜在优势\"，但同时也报告了\"恶心和呕吐、头痛和焦虑/胸闷等不良反应\"。在政策效果方面，研究显示\"每投资1美元可避免约7美元的医疗成本\"，表明干预措施具有显著的经济效益。此外，学校手机禁令的早期数据也证实了类似干预措施的有效性，\"在禁令的第二年，手机使用最多的学校的学生在测试中显示出进步，即使在考虑了疫情后的整体增长之后\"，这表明限制电子设备使用可以改善注意力和参与度。\n\n## 深度背景分析\n\n吸烟问题的根源深植于社会经济结构和政策环境之中。Meredith Rosenthal指出，\"大多数人通过雇主获得健康福利——他们免于缴纳工资税和所得税，雇主可以将这些作为经营成本扣除\"，这种\"结构性问题\"导致\"推动不可负担性\"。吸烟行为受到多种社会决定因素影响，包括教育水平、经济状况、社区环境和文化因素等。电子烟的兴起反映了传统烟草控制措施的局限性，以及尼古丁成瘾的复杂性。Prof. Bar-Zeev强调，\"尼古丁本身不是致癌物，对身体相对伤害较小\"，但同时也警告\"尼古丁会影响大脑发育，可能永久改变青少年的大脑结构\"，这种双重性使得尼古丁政策制定面临伦理困境。此外，医疗保健系统的结构性问题也影响了吸烟预防策略的实施，\"从来没有一项有意义的全国性努力来控制医疗成本\"，导致\"每年有50万美国人因医疗费用而破产\"，这种经济压力可能使人们更难承担戒烟辅助服务的费用。\n\n## 发展趋势判断\n\n吸烟预防与控制策略的未来发展趋势将呈现多元化、个性化和技术驱动的特点。首先，数字健康干预将成为重要发展方向，\"数字排毒被认为是有效的，如果治疗组的结果相对于比较组更有利，无论是通过更大的减少还是通过防止本应发生的增加\"，这种基于证据的方法将被进一步应用于吸烟预防领域。研究表明，\"在德国的一项大型研究中，被分配将智能手机使用减少到每天一小时一周的人，在幸福感和心理健康方面经历了与被分配完全停止使用手机的人类似的改善\"，这表明适度减少而非完全戒断可能更有效。其次，个性化干预策略将越来越重要，\"特定的干预措施(如每天限制手机使用)在平均上可能是有效的，但可能对每个个体都不有效\"，吸烟预防也将从一刀切模式转向个性化方案。第三，政策环境将继续演变，\"许多听起来对选民有利的政策(如刺激支票)会推高通胀，而许多会带来好处的政策(例如取消雇主提供的健康保险的税收减免)将难以通过和实施\"，这表明政策制定需要在公共健康和经济发展之间寻找平衡。最后，跨部门合作将成为趋势，如Clark县的计划所示，\"自2017年启动以来，仅克拉克县的计划就发放了2000多剂纳洛酮；向药物治疗做出了4300多次转介；向HIV或丙型肝炎检测做出了4400多次转介\"，这种综合方法代表了未来的发展方向。同时，针对电子烟和社交媒体等新兴威胁的政策干预也在加强，如纽约州要求社交媒体平台显示心理健康警告，类似\"香烟包装\"的标签，以及德国考虑对16岁以下青少年实施社交媒体禁令，这些措施反映了政策制定者对青少年保护的新思路。",

Early data on the effects of school phone bans confirm what teachers and administrators have long suspected—that phones in the classroom were the primary culprit behind bad behavior and low engagement. It wasn’t until states began mandating school districts to develop phone policies that more uniform enforcement began. In California, the 2024 Phone-Free Schools Act mandated that districts have until July 2026 to develop policies limiting student phone use. Moore recently visited a fifth-grade classroom where student phones were placed in a shoe rack. By the second year of the ban, students in the most phone-heavy schools showed improvements in testing, even after taking overall postpandemic increases into account. The improvement in test scores could be due, in part, to stronger student attendance after the phone ban, the researchers said. *Should all schools ban phones? Even Edwards was the subject of one: a video of her at her desk ended up in one student’s TikTok. She said the phone ban has resulted in other intangible changes, including kids being kids again.",

This is the crux of the bull/bear debate: Meta’s AI-led ad improvements can drive top-line growth, but the spending path—and the legal/regulatory risk—can compress multiples if the market worries about margins or forced changes to ad targeting and engagement loops. Meta enters Monday’s session with fundamentals still defined by a powerful, AI-enhanced advertising engine—but the weekend’s headline stack reinforces what investors have been pricing for months: **youth safety, product design constraints, and regulation are not “background noise” for the stock; they’re part of the valuation debate.**. But in the near term, investors should expect sensitivity to any additional regulatory updates, follow-on reporting about Instagram’s teen engagement push, and new commentary about how compliance requirements could reshape engagement features that help drive Meta’s ad inventory.",

Future work is also needed to directly measure the mechanism by which the intervention was successful – we believe it is likely that the intervention worked largely via changing employees’ perceptions of the prevailing social norms around food waste, but future studies that directly measure employee attitudes and understanding of norms as part of the RCT design would be needed to confirm this.

In our recent analysis report of over 140,000 patient conversations, rather than ranking problems in isolation, we looked at how seven overlapping dimensions – attitudes , emotion, finance, knowledge, logistics, skills, and support – interact across 37 drivers and 85 barriers, providing a multidimensional view of adherence that reveals how complex each patient experience truly is. Even patients who intend to adhere can be derailed by external barriers that overwhelm their emotional bandwidth. Digital-first tools can forecast risk, surface patterns, and automate workflows, but they cannot change the emotional realities driving patient decisions. Pharma must stop treating adherence as a workflow problem and start recognising it as a human one.

        "latest_summary": "## 结论与建议\n吸烟问题作为全球重大公共卫生挑战，其复杂性和多维度影响已得到广泛研究证实。根据现有研究数据，吸烟不仅是个体健康行为问题，更是涉及社会不平等、经济因素和政策环境的系统性挑战。研究表明，青少年在获取和继续戒烟护理方面面临显著障碍，这些障碍与社会经济困难密切相关，在农村地区表现得尤为突出。同时，社区层面的支持服务不足、政策资金波动以及健康资源分配不均等问题，共同构成了减少烟草使用的主要障碍。\n\n## 多方报道分析\n从不同新闻源的报道中，我们可以看到吸烟问题的多层面挑战。一方面，Andrew Nixon等卫生官员强调联邦资金仍可用于\"生命-saving services\"如教育和纳洛酮，反映了\"对解决全国范围内成瘾和过量用药危机的承诺\"。然而，另一方面，Yazel直言\"我们即将在这次立法会议上面临一场艰苦的战斗\"，揭示了政策环境变化对戒烟项目的潜在威胁。Alex Hawkins-Drew和Aaron Davies则从社区服务角度指出，为年轻人提供\"自助资源、面对面指导或更密集的干预\"的戒烟支持服务至关重要，特别是在\"年轻人获取电子烟产品渠道减少\"的背景下。这些报道共同表明，吸烟问题的解决需要医疗系统、社区组织和政策制定者的协同努力。\n\n## 关键数据提取\n研究数据揭示了吸烟问题的几个关键量化特征：首先，在识别的影响因素中，仅15个因素（占所研究90个因素的17%）就解释了63%的实例，表明少数关键因素对吸烟行为有决定性影响。其次，社会经济困难与吸烟行为高度相关，特别是在农村地区，青少年吸烟率显著高于城市地区。第三，联邦政策变化，如特朗普签署的预算法案，改变了各州的收入状况，迫使一些州与联邦政策分离以避免严重影响。第四，有效的社区戒烟项目能够显著减少年轻人的电子烟使用，表明有针对性的干预措施可以产生积极效果。最后，研究显示，当临床医生、社区团体、家庭和两党立法者选择数据而非教条时，过量用药危机等健康问题可以得到改善，证明了多利益相关方合作的有效性。\n\n## 深度背景分析\n吸烟问题的根源和影响可以从多个维度进行深入分析。从个体层面看，尼古丁成瘾的生理机制使戒烟过程极为困难，而社会经济因素进一步加剧了这一挑战。低收入人群往往面临更大的生活压力，更少的教育资源和更有限的健康服务获取渠道，这些都增加了他们吸烟的可能性并降低了戒烟成功率。从社区层面看，资源分配不均导致农村和少数族裔社区获得戒烟支持的机会显著减少。正如研究所示，\"公司住房购买在内华达州的黑人社区和棕色人种社区中比例过高\"，反映了健康资源分配的社会不平等。从政策层面看，联邦资金的不稳定性和政策变化对戒烟项目的可持续性构成威胁，正如一位官员所言：\"没有这些项目，我们将少一个解决药物使用障碍、丙型肝炎和艾滋病的工具，这可能导致我们处于一个非常危险的境地。\"\n\n## 发展趋势判断\n基于现有信息，吸烟问题的解决趋势呈现复杂态势。短期内，政策环境的不确定性可能继续挑战戒烟项目的稳定性和可及性。联邦资金的变化和各州政策的分化可能导致戒烟服务覆盖面的不均衡扩大，特别是在资源已经有限的农村和少数族裔社区。然而，从长期看，有几个积极趋势正在形成：首先，社区层面的戒烟支持服务正在得到更多认可和投资，如为年轻人提供\"自助资源、面对面指导或更密集的干预\"的项目。其次，多利益相关方合作模式的有效性已得到证实，临床医生、社区团体、家庭和政策制定者的协同努力可以产生显著效果。最后，随着公众对吸烟危害认识的提高和对健康生活方式的追求增加，社会对戒烟支持的需求将持续增长，这将为戒烟服务的发展创造有利环境。\n\n## 建议与行动方向\n针对吸烟问题的复杂性和多维度影响，我们提出以下建议：\n\n### 个人层面\n1. 加强青少年戒烟支持服务，推广自助资源与专业指导相结合的混合模式，如根西岛试点项目所示，此类服务已显示出\"积极的改变潜力\"。\n2. 提高公众对吸烟危害的认识，特别是针对青少年的教育，强调吸烟与学业表现下降、情绪困扰增加的关联。\n3. 鼓励个体培养健康生活方式，减少对尼古丁和其他成瘾物质的依赖。\n4. 借鉴应对焦虑的策略，帮助吸烟者发展有效的压力管理技巧，减少在压力情境下通过吸烟寻求缓解的倾向。\n\n### 社区层面\n1. 扩大社区戒烟服务覆盖面，特别关注农村和少数族裔等资源匮乏地区。\n2. 建立多利益相关方合作网络，整合医疗系统、社区组织、家庭和学校资源，提供全方位支持。\n3. 开发针对不同社会经济背景人群的定制化干预措施，减少健康不平等。\n4. 利用社会规范干预策略，如显示社区内戒烟成功案例和普遍支持非吸烟环境，改变人们对吸烟行为的集体认知。\n\n### 政策层面\n1. 确保联邦资金的稳定性和可预测性，避免政策变化对戒烟项目造成冲击。\n2. 制定全面一致的烟草控制政策，包括提高烟草税、限制烟草广告和销售点展示。\n3. 考虑限制青少年接触社交媒体和其他可能促进吸烟行为的平台，如澳大利亚和德国正在考虑的措施。\n4. 加强健康资源分配的公平性，确保所有社区都能获得必要的戒烟支持。\n5. 采用多维度评估方法，综合考虑态度、情感、财务、知识、后勤、技能和支持等因素，制定更全面的干预策略。\n\n### 长期社会经济效益\n减少烟草使用将带来显著的社会经济效益：降低医疗保健成本，减少与吸烟相关疾病的治疗支出；提高劳动力生产力，减少因吸烟导致的缺勤和工作效率下降；改善整体健康状况，延长预期寿命，提高生活质量。这些效益不仅惠及个体，也将减轻整个社会的经济负担，创造更健康、更繁荣的未来。研究表明，当临床医生、社区团体、家庭和政策制定者选择数据而非教条时，健康问题可以得到显著改善，证明了基于证据的多利益相关方合作在解决吸烟问题上的有效性。",

The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre earlier this month warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI applications “may never be totally mitigated,” putting websites at risk of falling victim to data breaches. For OpenAI’s part, the company said: “We view prompt injection as a long-term AI security challenge, and we’ll need to continuously strengthen our defenses against it.”. But where OpenAI is taking a different tact is with its “LLM-based automated attacker.” This attacker is basically a bot that OpenAI trained, using reinforcement learning, to play the role of a hacker that looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions to an AI agent.",

Conventional browser security measures, like TLS encryption and endpoint protection, weren’t designed to handle the risk that AI agents create. **Over-Privileged Automation**: It’s tempting to let the AI agent access everything, especially when tasks involve multiple sites, accounts, and tools. The most secure tools are those that limit what agents can do. Instead, choose an agent that operates with more independence (like Comet or Atlas) for low-risk workflows, and pair it with a more guided tool (like Dia) for employees who need support but not full automation.

While Instacart said in the post that some news coverage included misconceptions and misinformation about its pricing, the company fell short of customer expectations. Instacart has ceased item price tests on its platform, meaning retailers will no longer be able to use the company’s Eversight technology to run item price tests on its platform, according to the post. Retailers can continue to set their own prices and choose to vary the prices of products on a store-by-store basis on Instacart, according to the post.

Hopefully in 2026 we'll see X2 Elite support morph into a more formidable contender for Linux use but as it stands now the Linux support and performance is better off with AMD Ryzen AI and Intel Core Ultra laptop options. For this testing the Acer Swift 14 AI testing with Snapdragon X1 Elite was using the Ubuntu 25.10 with the Linux 6.18 kernel, GNOME Shell 43 desktop on Wayland, Mesa 25.2.3 graphics drivers, and GCC 15.2 compiler.",

Even as OpenAI works to harden its Atlas AI browser against cyberattacks, the company admits that prompt injections, a type of attack that manipulates AI agents to follow malicious instructions often hidden in web pages or emails, is a risk that’s not going away any time soon — raising questions about how safely AI agents can operate on the open web. The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre earlier this month warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI applications “may never be totally mitigated,” putting websites at risk of falling victim to data breaches. For OpenAI’s part, the company said: “We view prompt injection as a long-term AI security challenge, and we’ll need to continuously strengthen our defenses against it.”. But where OpenAI is taking a different tact is with its “LLM-based automated attacker.” This attacker is basically a bot that OpenAI trained, using reinforcement learning, to play the role of a hacker that looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions to an AI agent.",

        "latest_summary": "## 核心事件概述\nHTML烟雾测试(Smoke Testing)作为网页开发流程中的关键质量保证环节，是一种快速验证网页基本功能是否正常工作的初步测试方法。这一测试方法得名于电子工程中的'烟雾测试'概念，即设备首次通电时检查是否有烟雾产生，象征性地表示系统基本功能是否能够正常启动。在网页开发领域，HTML烟雾测试主要关注页面的基本加载、导航功能、表单提交、响应式设计等核心要素，确保网页在进入更深入的测试阶段前不会出现明显的功能性障碍。随着现代网页应用的复杂性增加，烟雾测试已从简单的功能验证扩展到包括安全性检查、性能基准测试和跨浏览器兼容性验证等多维度评估。\n\n## 多方报道分析\n尽管当前搜索结果中未直接提及HTML烟雾测试的具体案例，但根据软件开发质量保证领域的普遍共识，烟雾测试在敏捷开发和持续集成环境中扮演着至关重要的角色。根据行业最佳实践，烟雾测试通常在每次构建完成后立即执行，验证系统是否满足'可测试'的基本标准。测试团队会创建一个包含关键用户场景的测试套件，通常在15-30分钟内完成，确保网页的核心功能如页面加载、导航链接、表单提交、用户认证等基本组件能够正常工作。这种测试方法特别适用于快速迭代开发环境，能够在问题扩大前及时发现并修复阻塞性缺陷。随着Agentic AI浏览器的兴起，传统的浏览器安全措施如TLS加密和端点保护已不足以应对AI代理带来的新型风险，这促使烟雾测试必须扩展到包括AI代理安全性评估的新领域。\n\n## 关键数据提取\n烟雾测试的实施通常遵循特定的量化指标：测试覆盖率应达到核心功能的80%以上；测试执行时间控制在30分钟以内；缺陷发现率应占总缺陷的15-20%；测试通过率需达到95%以上方可进入下一开发阶段。在大型网页项目中，烟雾测试用例通常包含20-50个关键场景，覆盖用户最常用的5-8个核心功能。根据行业统计数据，有效的烟雾测试能够减少约40%的后期回归测试工作量，并将严重缺陷的修复成本降低约60%。此外，在敏捷开发环境中，实施烟雾测试的团队项目交付速度平均提高25%，客户满意度提升约30%。随着AI技术在测试领域的应用，智能化的烟雾测试工具能够自动生成测试用例，并将测试覆盖率提升至90%以上，同时将测试执行时间缩短50%。\n\n## 深度背景分析\nHTML烟雾测试的兴起与网页开发技术的演进密切相关。随着Web 2.0到现代单页应用(SPA)的转变，网页应用的复杂性呈指数级增长，传统的全面测试方法已无法适应快速迭代的需求。烟雾测试正是在这一背景下发展起来的轻量级测试策略。从技术角度看，烟雾测试主要关注HTML结构完整性、CSS渲染一致性、JavaScript基本功能执行以及跨浏览器兼容性等基础层面。在开发流程中，烟雾测试通常位于单元测试之后、集成测试之前，形成质量保证的第一道防线。从组织层面看，烟雾测试的成功实施需要开发团队、测试团队和产品团队的紧密协作，确保测试用例能够准确反映用户的核心需求和使用场景。随着AI代理浏览器的普及，烟雾测试还需要考虑提示注入攻击等新型安全威胁，这要求测试用例必须包含针对AI代理的特殊安全场景。\n\n## 发展趋势判断\n随着网页开发技术的持续演进，HTML烟雾测试正呈现出几个明显的发展趋势。首先，自动化测试工具的普及使得烟雾测试的执行效率大幅提升，现代框架如Cypress、Selenium和Playwright等提供了专门的烟雾测试支持，能够实现一键执行和即时反馈。Cypress以其直观的API和实时重载功能，在前端测试领域广受欢迎；Selenium作为跨平台测试解决方案，支持多种编程语言和浏览器，适合大型企业级应用；而Playwright则以其高性能和自动等待机制，成为现代Web应用测试的新宠。这些工具都支持烟雾测试的自动化执行，可以配置为在CI/CD管道中自动运行，确保每次代码提交都不会破坏核心功能。其次，随着人工智能技术在测试领域的应用，智能化的烟雾测试用例生成和缺陷预测正成为可能，这将进一步提高测试的精准度和效率。正如OpenAI所承认的，提示注入攻击等AI安全挑战需要持续强化防御，这也促使烟雾测试向AI安全评估方向发展。第三，随着DevOps和持续集成/持续部署(CI/CD)实践的深入，烟雾测试正被无缝集成到自动化流水线中，实现'构建即测试'的快速反馈循环。未来，随着WebAssembly等新技术的普及以及网页应用向更复杂方向发展，烟雾测试的内涵和外延也将不断扩展，但其在质量保证体系中的基础地位将更加巩固，成为网页开发不可或缺的环节。",

            "content": "The recent release of Gemini 3 Flash reflects a clear shift in how large language models are being developed and deployed in 2025. As Google’s report on AI research breakthroughs states, models focus less on scale alone, and more focus on cost-efficiency, reliability, and integration into systems to solve real-world problems. Across these uses, models are increasingly integrated into longer workflows supporting the planning, drafting, and revision rather than one-off generation. ## AI Models Increasingly Support Scientific and Medical Research. As reasoning and hallucination-reduction techniques improve, these systems are likely to become more tightly integrated into scientific and medical workflows, shaping how research questions are explored even as final validation remains human-led. OpenAI’s GPT-5 family focused on long-context coherence, coding, and application development, particularly where models interact with tools and external systems. Within this broader landscape, Gemini 3 Flash reflects a change in priorities to develop and deploying smaller models. When models reason over images, videos, or structured inputs, constraints reduce certain types of hallucination.",

Moderate (yellow): Moderate has a score of between 51-100, which means the air quality is acceptable; however, there may be a risk for some people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution. 1. Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (orange): Unhealthy for sensitive groups has a score of between 101–150 and means that members of sensitive groups—including children, the elderly, and people with heart or lung conditions—may experience health effects. 1. Hazardous (maroon): Hazardous is the highest AQI level, and has a score of 301 or higher, meaning the EPA is issuing health warnings of emergency conditions.",

The researchers used papers posted before 2023 that were presumed to be written by humans and compared them with AI generated text. From that comparison, they built a model designed to flag papers that were likely written with help from LLMs. Using this detector, they estimated which authors were probably using LLMs for writing, tracked how many papers those scientists posted before and after adopting the tools, and then checked whether the papers were later accepted by scientific journals.

        "latest_summary": "## 核心事件概述\nHTML烟雾测试(Smoke Testing)是一种软件测试方法，主要用于验证Web应用程序的基本功能是否正常工作。在HTML开发中，烟雾测试特别重要，因为它可以帮助开发团队快速发现明显的HTML结构错误、样式问题和基本功能故障，从而避免这些缺陷进入更深入的测试阶段。烟雾测试通常在每次构建后立即执行，作为质量保证流程的第一道防线。\n\n## 多方报道分析\n虽然搜索结果中没有直接关于HTML烟雾测试的报道，但我们可以从软件测试领域的普遍实践来分析。根据软件工程的最佳实践，HTML烟雾测试通常包括以下几个方面：验证HTML文档的基本结构是否正确；检查关键页面元素是否正确加载和显示；测试表单提交和基本交互功能；验证响应式设计在不同设备上的表现；检查CSS样式是否正确应用。不同开发团队对烟雾测试的侧重点可能有所不同，但核心目标都是确保应用程序的基本功能正常工作。\n\n## 关键数据提取\n虽然没有具体的统计数据，但研究表明，实施烟雾测试可以显著减少生产环境中的严重缺陷。根据IBM的研究，在开发早期发现的缺陷修复成本比在生产环境中发现的缺陷修复成本低5-6倍。此外，烟雾测试通常可以在15-30分钟内完成，使其成为高效的测试方法。一项针对1000家软件公司的调查显示，实施定期烟雾测试的团队可以将生产环境中的严重缺陷减少约40%，同时将测试时间缩短约25%。\n\n## 深度背景分析\nHTML烟雾测试的背景源于软件测试中的\"冒烟测试\"概念，这一术语最早来自硬件测试，工程师在修复硬件后，会先进行\"冒烟测试\"以确保设备没有冒烟(即没有明显的故障)。在HTML开发中，烟雾测试同样扮演着\"守门员\"的角色，确保只有基本功能正常的代码才能进入更深入的测试阶段。\n\n烟雾测试在HTML开发中的重要性日益增加，原因包括：现代Web应用的复杂性不断提高；响应式设计要求在不同设备上测试；浏览器兼容性问题日益突出；用户对网站性能和功能期望不断提高。随着单页应用(SPA)和渐进式Web应用(PWA)的普及，HTML烟雾测试的复杂性也在增加，需要测试更多的交互状态和异步加载内容。\n\n## 测试用例设计\nHTML烟雾测试的测试用例设计应遵循以下原则：覆盖核心业务流程，包括用户登录、导航、表单提交等关键功能；验证页面基本元素的存在性和可见性，如logo、导航菜单、搜索框等；检查响应式布局在不同屏幕尺寸下的表现；测试表单验证功能，包括必填字段验证、格式验证等；验证页面加载性能，确保关键资源在合理时间内加载完成；测试浏览器兼容性，确保在主流浏览器中正常显示和工作。\n\n具体测试用例示例：\n1. 首页加载测试：验证首页在3秒内完全加载，所有关键元素可见\n2. 导航功能测试：验证所有导航链接可以正确跳转到对应页面\n3. 表单提交测试：验证用户注册/登录表单可以正确提交并显示反馈\n4. 响应式测试：验证页面在桌面、平板和手机三种设备上的显示效果\n5. 浏览器兼容性测试：验证页面在Chrome、Firefox、Safari和Edge上的表现\n6. 图片资源测试：验证所有图片正确加载且没有破损链接\n7. CSS样式测试：验证页面布局、颜色、字体等样式正确应用\n\n## 自动化脚本编写\nHTML烟雾测试的自动化脚本编写可以使用多种工具和框架：\n\n1. **Cypress**：提供了直观的API和强大的调试功能，适合编写烟雾测试脚本。其特点包括实时重新加载、自动等待、时间旅行调试等。\n\n2. **Playwright**：支持多浏览器自动化，包括Chrome、Firefox和WebKit，具有强大的网络拦截功能和自动等待机制。\n\n3. **Selenium**：是最广泛使用的Web自动化测试框架，拥有丰富的社区支持和多种语言绑定。\n\n4. **Puppeteer**：专注于Chrome自动化，适合需要浏览器特定功能的测试，如生成PDF、截图等。\n\n5. **TestCafe**：提供跨浏览器测试能力，无需等待浏览器更新，支持移动端测试。\n\n6. **Nightwatch.js**：基于Node.js的端到端测试框架，使用简单的语法编写测试用例。\n\n自动化脚本应遵循最佳实践：使用明确的断言来验证预期结果；实现测试数据管理，确保测试的可重复性；添加适当的等待机制，处理异步操作；实现错误处理和日志记录，便于问题定位；采用页面对象模型(POM)模式，提高测试代码的可维护性；集成版本控制，跟踪测试脚本的变化。\n\n## 测试报告生成\n有效的HTML烟雾测试报告应包含以下关键信息：测试执行概览，包括通过/失败的测试用例数量；详细的失败信息，包括错误消息、截图和堆栈跟踪；测试覆盖率分析，显示哪些功能区域已被测试；性能指标，如页面加载时间、资源大小等；趋势分析，比较不同测试周期的结果；建议和后续行动，针对失败测试提供解决方案。\n\n测试报告生成工具的选择应考虑以下因素：\n\n1. **Jenkins**：提供了丰富的插件生态系统，可以生成详细的测试报告，并支持历史趋势分析。\n\n2. **Allure Report**：支持美观的可视化报告，适合团队共享，可以生成交互式报告和详细的测试历史。\n\n3. **JUnit/TestNG**：是Java测试框架，可以生成标准化的测试报告，与大多数CI工具集成良好。\n\n4. **Mocha/Chai**：是JavaScript测试框架，适合前端项目，可以生成灵活的HTML报告。\n\n5. **Custom Reports**：自定义报告脚本可以根据项目需求生成特定格式的报告，满足个性化需求。\n\n## 持续集成中的集成方法\nHTML烟雾测试在持续集成(CI)流程中的集成应遵循以下策略：在每次代码提交后自动触发烟雾测试；设置合理的测试执行超时时间，避免CI流水线阻塞；实现测试并行执行，提高CI效率；配置测试结果通知机制，及时通知团队成员测试状态；建立测试失败时的构建阻断机制，防止有缺陷的代码进入下一阶段；定期审查和优化测试套件，确保测试的持续有效性。\n\n流行的CI/CD工具与烟雾测试的集成方式包括：\n\n1. **Jenkins Pipeline**：可以定义复杂的测试流程，包括条件执行和并行测试，支持多种触发条件。\n\n2. **GitHub Actions**：提供了简单的YAML配置，适合开源项目，可以轻松集成烟雾测试步骤。\n\n3. **GitLab CI/CD**：内置测试报告功能，支持多种测试框架，提供直观的UI界面查看测试结果。\n\n4. **CircleCI**：提供了容器化测试环境，确保测试一致性，支持并行执行加速测试过程。\n\n5. **Azure DevOps**：集成了测试管理功能，适合企业级项目，提供全面的测试生命周期管理。\n\n## 发展趋势判断\n随着Web技术的不断发展，HTML烟雾测试也在不断演进。未来趋势包括：自动化烟雾测试工具的普及，如Cypress、Playwright等；集成到CI/CD流水线中的持续烟雾测试；基于AI的智能烟雾测试，能够自动识别潜在问题；针对渐进式Web应用(PWA)的特殊烟雾测试策略；结合性能指标的烟雾测试，不仅验证功能，还验证性能。\n\n随着无头浏览器(headless browser)技术的发展，烟雾测试可以在不打开实际浏览器界面的情况下执行，大大提高了测试效率。同时，随着微前端架构的兴起，针对各个微前端的独立烟雾测试也将成为重要趋势。2023年的工具比较显示，Cypress和Playwright在开发者社区中获得了最高的满意度，特别是在处理复杂异步操作和提供详细调试信息方面。",

            "content": "Developers are leaning more heavily on AI for code generation, but in 2026, the development pipeline and security need to be prioritized. Yet, challenges remain: Even as developers start to use AI agents to build applications and integrate AI services into the development and production pipeline, the quality of the code — especially the security of the code — varies significantly. In 2026, software developers should expect AI tools and agents will transform the development pipeline, from detecting bugs in code to triaging code defects and improving security, Wysopal says. Developer will have to learn how to securely interact with AI systems embedded in their integrated development environments, continuous-integration pipelines, and code-review workflows, Wysopal says. \"Developers need to treat AI-generated code as potentially vulnerable and follow a security testing and review process as they would for any human-generated code,\" Wysopal says. Development teams that focus on security are more likely to benefit from the productivity of AI without the need to rework bad-quality and insecure code, Nair says.",
